          Travel & Tour is a responsive travel website showcasing various
          destinations and tour packages. The site features a modern,
          user-friendly design built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key features include an interactive booking form where users can
          select their travel dates and preferences, destination cards
          highlighting popular locations with images and details, and a
          testimonials section sharing customer reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes.
          Bootstrap was used for the layout grid system and components, while
          custom CSS adds unique styling touches. JavaScript handles form
          validation and interactive elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Bootstrap's
          component library and responsive design principles. I also focused on
          creating an engaging user experience through thoughtful UI/UX design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clean, modern aesthetic combined with smooth animations and
          transitions creates an appealing showcase for travel destinations
          while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility.

          Fresh Food is a modern food delivery website designed to provide a
          seamless ordering experience for customers craving quality meals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website features an extensive menu section organized by food
          categories, making it easy for users to browse and find their desired
          items. Each dish is presented with appetizing images, detailed
          descriptions, and pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key feature is the interactive contact form that allows customers to
          place orders directly through the website. The form includes fields
          for delivery details and special instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site is built with a responsive design using Bootstrap's grid
          system, ensuring a consistent experience across all devices. Custom
          CSS adds unique styling elements while JavaScript powers the
          interactive features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Special attention was paid to the user interface, with smooth
          animations and transitions creating an engaging browsing experience.
          The clean layout and intuitive navigation help users quickly find and
          order their favorite foods.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project demonstrates my ability to create visually appealing,
          functional websites that provide real value to users while maintaining
          high standards of performance and accessibility.
